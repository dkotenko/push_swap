School 42 project: 2 stacks sorting problem

Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

[Image source and project explanation](https://medium.com/@jamierobertdawson/push-swap-the-least-amount-of-moves-with-two-stacks-d1e76a71789a)

**This implementation contains:**
- presorting by splitting stack A in 2 chunks consecutively
- best move evaluation
- 2 stacks shift
- Python vizualisation
- file reading


**What can be done:**
- change one-pointed shifts of 2 stacks by double-shift operations 
- better move evaluation

**How to use Python vizualisation:**  
./push_swap "filename or args squence" | python3 push_swap.py "filename or args squence"
